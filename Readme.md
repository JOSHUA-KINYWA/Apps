# Project Overview
For this project, we're working as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. We make our apps available on Google Play and in the App Store. The goal is to identify which apps are highly distributed on google playstore

Some of questions visuals will try to answer are:
    Which category is highly represented?
    Do you users consider paid apps over free apps?
    Do size of app matter?
    which apps have high rating? 
    are paid apps rated higher than free apps?
    
**Project Steps**

Exploring Data types
Correcting data types
Distribution of app ratings
Size and price of app
